# Insurance Customer Analytics & Predictive Modeling

Machine learning project focused on customer analytics for an insurance company, including similarity detection, classification, regression modeling, and data protection techniques.

## Objective

Evaluate how machine learning models can support insurance decision-making processes such as customer segmentation, benefit prediction, and privacy-preserving data transformations.

## Tasks

### 1. Customer Similarity Detection
- Identification of similar clients using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN).
- Comparison of distance metrics:
  - Euclidean
  - Manhattan
- Analysis with and without feature scaling.

### 2. Benefit Prediction (Classification)
- Predict probability of a client receiving insurance benefits.
- Comparison against baseline (dummy) models.

### 3. Benefit Quantity Prediction (Regression)
- Linear regression model to estimate number of insurance benefits.

### 4. Data Protection
- Development of data masking transformation.
- Preservation of model performance while protecting personal data.

## Data Analysis

- Dataset consistency validation.
- Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis.
- Pairwise visualization to detect hidden patterns.
- Feature scaling impact evaluation.

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
